# DSCI-552 -- Machine-Learning-for-Data-Science

## Course Outline:
This is a foundational course mainly focused on data analytics. The goal is to give students the essential tools and concepts needed to understand how data can be collected, processed, analyzed, and used to support decision-making. What makes the course approachable is that it is not limited to just one type of background. Students coming from technical areas like computer science, engineering, or mathematics will be able to dive deeper into the computational and mathematical aspects, while students from less technical areas such as business, communication, accounting, medicine, or genomics will be able to connect the methods to real-world problems in their own fields.

The course is structured in a way that bridges the gap between theory and application. For technical students it strengthens their ability to apply programming, statistics, and mathematical models to data problems. For non-technical students it emphasizes how data analytics can be applied directly in professional contexts such as business strategy, healthcare decision-making, or managing information systems. In the end the course provides a shared foundation where students from different disciplines can all speak the language of data and use it to solve problems.

## Course Objective: 
- Broadly understand major algorithms used in machine learning.
